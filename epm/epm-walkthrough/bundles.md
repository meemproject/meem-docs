# Bundles

This is where we get into the “package” part of Ethereum Package Manager. Multiple facet contracts can be combined to create a bundle. The bundle can then easily be applied to a diamond proxy contract.

You can search for bundles at [https://epm.wtf/bundles](https://epm.wtf/bundles), select a diamond proxy contract, and then “cut” (apply) that bundle onto the diamond.

In the above example we’re deploying a Clubs contract. This is what’s happening behind the scenes over at [https://clubs.link](https://clubs.link).
