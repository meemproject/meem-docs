# Splits / Royalties

Splits specify the royalties structure that should be used when a Meem is sold. Any number of addresses can be set to receive a payout.

Meem also aims to be maximally compatible with existing and emerging standards. Splits are currently compatible with Rarible Royalties V2 ([https://docs.rarible.org/ethereum/smart-contracts/royalties/](https://docs.rarible.org/ethereum/smart-contracts/royalties/)).

When implemented properly by a marketplace, sales should pay out royalties based on the splits.
