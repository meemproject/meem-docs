### What is Meem?

Meem offers a simple (no-code) solution to create a web3 online community. In addition, we've created a suite of tools (community extensions) to help you and your members collaborate through custom applications and integrations.

Under the hood, a [Meem](https://clubs.link) community is just one use case of the [Smart Contracts](../meem-contracts/meem-smart-contracts.md) developed by the Meem Team. Meem creates a unique smart contract for your community (aka Community Agreement) **that you own**. That means if you want to customize it, you can!



### What can I do with my Meem community?

**Manage Community Members**\
Add or remove community members from your community membership settings page. You can also delegate admin privilages to your community agreement.

**Seamless On-Chain Transactions**\
By delegating admin privileges of your Community Agreement to Meem, you can perform a variety of on-chain tasks without you or your members having to deal with signing multiple transactions or paying gas fees. You can easily remove Meem as an admin at any time.

**Roles**\
By creating Roles for your community, you can manage member access and permissions across applications built on Meem. Also, since roles are unique smart contracts **owned by your community**, you can use your community roles to manage access to a number of other web3 applications outside of Meem.

**Collaborate with Extensions**\
Meem is working on a library of community extensions that will provide tools for community collaboration within the Meem website or a number of external applications.

### How can I build an extension for my Meem community?
