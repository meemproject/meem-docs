# Configuring your Extension

### Saving extension configuration settings

You can store any metadata you need to manage your extension settings by calling the `updateAgreementExtension` method of the Meem SDK. This is useful for storing community-specific configuration settings. **Note: Do not store any sensitive data in your extension's metadata.** This data will be readable by anyone with membership access to your community.
