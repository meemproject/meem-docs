# ðŸ’¡ Why Build with Meem?

At it's core, Meem smart contracts extend the [ERC-721 NFT standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

### You own the contract

While we provide tools to deploy and manage your contract, only your wallet (and others you set as admins) control the smart contract. There is no middleman. Your keys, your contract.

### No-code or Full-code

With Meem, you can deploy your own ERC-721 compatible NFT project without any coding. You can also upgrade to new versions as core features are released as new versions of the Meem protocol.

But, if you're feeling hacky you should read about [Ethereum Package Manager](../epm/ethereum-package-manager.md).
