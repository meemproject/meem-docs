# Authentication

Some Meem API endpoints require the user to be authenticated. During login, the API will return a JWT token that can be sent in subsequent requests to perform authenticated actions.

To send an authenticated request you'll need to include a header:

`Authorization: JWT <token>`

The base API url is: [https://api.meem.wtf/](https://api.meem.wtf/)
